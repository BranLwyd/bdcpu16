=======

DCPU-16 simulator based on version 1.7 of the DCPU-16 specification. See http://dcpu.com/.

This is currently in active development and probably won't be useful to someone who just wants to play around with the DCPU-16. Fortunately there are plenty of more mature DCPU simulators out there. :)
